	<li class="improvement">
		<h5>Using the new ability videos</h5>
		<p>Now using ability videos that are used within the League Client instead of outdated once from the League of Legends websites.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="bugfix">
		<h5>Champion detection rework</h5>
		<p>Since the legacy League Client was removed the champion detection was really slow. Not Champions within the game, and therefore the app-start should be back to normal.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul id="2.3.14" class="padded-bot-half padded-left-2 padded-right-2">
	<li class="improvement">
		<h5>Overwolf internal update</h5>
		<p>Preparing the app for overwolf's new engine (client version 0.100+)</p>
	</li>
	<li class="bugfix">
		<h5>Match Window behaviour</h5>

	<li class="feature">
		<h5>Garena Servers now work</h5>
		<p>Garena Players now can use Champ 101 too.</p>
		<p>Since Garena does not offer it's own data-API currently the data from Riots NA Servers is used within the
		   app. That means the Leaue versions might not always match as they don't update at exactly the same time.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="feature">
		<h5>Fetching Summoner and Server automatically</h5>
		<p>Summonername and Server don't have to be set manually anymore. If no RIOT-Server could be identified it is
		   assumed that the game plays on a garena Server (Champion-data from NA will be used then).</p>
		<p>This Mechanic enables the App to fetch any kind of game, even with bots or with disabled spectators!</p>
	</li>
	<li class="feature">
		<h5>Changelog integrated</h5>
	</li>
	<li class="improvement">
		<h5>Replays and Spectates don't require Champ 101</h5>
		<p>When spectating a game or your replays, the app will no longer start automatically.</p>
		<p>It is still possible to open the Match overview manually if you want to.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="improvement">
		<h5>Version shown on Main Window</h5>
	</li>
	<li class="bugfix">
		<h5>Correct Github Issue Link</h5>
		<p>Now you actually can find the github-issues through the link.</p>
	</li>
	<li class="bugfix">
		<h5>The App now closes completely after a game ends</h5>
		<p>There is no lingering Main-Window in the background anymore. The option to keep the Match open still works as
		   before.</p>
